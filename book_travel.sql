(1, 'Dhaka', 'Dhaka', '1464', '<p><strong>Dhaka</strong> (or <em>Dacca</em>) is the capital and largest city of <a title="Bangladesh" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. It is the cultural and economic hub of the country. Having a colossal historical background, the old part of the city, known as <em>Old Dhaka</em> or <em>Old Town</em>, is home to a broad range of architectural heritage starting from the vestiges of the Mughal Empire to the British Colonial buildings. Being the centre of the independence movements of Bangladesh, Dhaka also hosts some significant national monuments and structures. There are a number of annual cultural events held in Dhaka like Pohela Falgun, Pohela Baishakh and Ekushe Book Fair which add a unique flavour to the city.</p>\r\n<p>The modernization and development of Dhaka during the last couple of decades and a corrupt governing and middle class has made the development of international five star chain hotels profitable and spurred the building of some of the largest shopping malls in the world. There are some cracking amusement parks and a surplus of cheap labour has meant that international restaurant chains are cheaper here than in the neighbouring countries.</p>', '<p>Dhaka is a thriving, colourful and congested metropolis of some 18 million people. Given the number of people that live there, and the density they live in, Dhaka is one of the most frenetic places on Earth. The streets and rivers are filled with colourful chaos. It also plays host to the highest number of rickshaws in any city in the world, totalling around 400,000; you certainly won''t miss them. Experiencing the city for the first time can often seem overwhelming.</p>\r\n<p>The existence of a settlement in the area that is now Dhaka dates from the 7th century. The area was ruled by the Buddhist kingdom of Kamarupa and the Pala Empire before passing to the control of the Hindu Sena dynasty in the 9th century. The Islamic Mughal Empire soon seized control of the city and turned it into a centre of trade and governance. In the years of their vigorous rule, the successive governors and princely viceroys who ruled the province adorned it with many noble monuments, mosques, tombs, fortifications and ''Katras'', often surrounded with beautifully laid out gardens and pavilions. The city passed through another phase under the rule of the British, until it became the seat of the eastern division of Pakistan after Indian partitioning. The Liberation War of 1971 gave Bangladesh its independence and Dhaka was declared the country''s capital.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, Dhaka has been developing fast as a modern city and is the country''s centre of industrial, commercial, cultural, educational and political activity. The gap between rich and poor is widening throughout the country, but it''s at its most glaringly obvious here. Depending on where you start from, a thirty minute rickshaw ride can take you from impossibly crowded shanty towns near Old Dhaka to the glitzy high-class neighbourhoods of Gulshan and Banani where a meal costs more than most people earn in a week.</p>\r\n<p>Motijheel is the main commercial area of the city. Dhaka''s main waterfront, Sadarghat, is on the banks of the river Buriganga in Old Dhaka and is crowded with various ferries, yachts, paddle steamers, fisherman''s boats and floating dhabas all bustling with activity.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>weather</strong> is tropical - hot and very humid during the summer monsoon season (April-September) and drier and cooler in the winter (October-March). Visitors from colder countries might want to visit in the winter when temperatures are around 20C and humidity is low (around 60-70%).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visa extensions</strong> are available at the Immigration and Passport Office on Agargaon Road in Central Dhaka. Most rickshaws and taxis will know where this is. An auto-rickshaw from Old Dhaka to the office will cost about Tk 150.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="Language" class="mw-headline">Language</span></h3>\r\n<p>Most of the people will speak Bengali to communicate. Although some Urdu/Hindi speaking population resides in some parts of Old Dhaka, in Bihari Camp in Mipur and in Geneva Camp in Mohammadpur. You can find English speaking people but do not expect the CNG drivers or ricksha-walas to speak English. Just smile and repeatedly mention your destination if you don''t get what they are saying.</p>', '<h3><span id="By_boat" class="mw-headline">By boat</span></h3>\r\n<p>Boat (lancher) to Barisal departs from Sadarghat every evening 08:00-21:00.

Additionally, there are two more international airports in the Sylhet, a north-east divisional city, and Chittagong, the south-east and second largest city of Bangladesh, respectively. The Sylhet International Airport is called Osmani International Airport [code: ZYL] and Chittagong International Aiprot is called Shah Amanat International Airport [code: CGP]. These two international airports are also well connected with many parts of the world with direct flight from and to many Asian and Middle Eastern countries including China, Malaysia, UAE etc when Sylhet airport has direct flight from London, where a huge number of Bangladeshi origin people are living particularly from Sylhet region.</p>\r\n<p>There are frequent services from surrounding countries. Biman operates flights to most of these. Indian carrier <strong>Jet Air</strong> has direct flights from <a title="Kolkata" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Dehli" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Dehli">Dehli</a> and <a title="Mumbai" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. <strong>Pakistan International Airlines</strong> has flights from <a title="Karachi" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Karachi">Karachi</a>.

However, excessive numbers of mosquitoes seem to inhabit the baggage reclaim area, so be sure to wear long sleeves and cover your legs and feet. Immigration can take a notoriously long time during peak hours (45 minutes plus) as the system is manual and there are only 2 lines for foreign passport holders.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_rail" class="mw-headline">By rail</span></h3>\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 392px;"><a class="image" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/File:Map_Bangladesh_RoadRail.png"><img class="thumbimage" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/en/thumb/b/bd/Map_Bangladesh_RoadRail.png/390px-Map_Bangladesh_RoadRail.png" alt="" width="390" height="509" data-file-width="914" data-file-height="1194" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="thumb tright">\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 392px;">\r\n<div class="thumbcaption">Map of Railway system in Bangladesh; <a class="new" title="Jamuna Bridge (page does not exist)" href="http://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Jamuna_Bridge&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Jamuna Bridge</a> not shown.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="thumb tright">\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 392px;"><a class="image" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/File:Kamlan.jpg"><img class="thumbimage" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/en/thumb/2/21/Kamlan.jpg/390px-Kamlan.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="267" data-file-width="720" data-file-height="493" /></a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="thumb tright">\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 392px;">\r\n<div class="thumbcaption">Kamalapur Railway Station</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The <strong>Maitree Express</strong> <a class="external autonumber" href="http://indiarailinfo.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">[2]</a> was reopened in 2008, and is a direct service from <a title="Kolkata" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, <a title="India" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/India">India</a>. It is the only international rail service in Bangladesh. The train is renowned for attracting few passengers, running below 50% occupancy. Trains from Kolkata to Dhaka depart Tuesdays and Saturdays, and the reverse departs Tuesdays and Sundays. The journey to Dhaka takes 10 hours 50 minutes, and the train to Kolkata takes 11 hours 45 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>The train has been criticised due to the long waits at the border crossings on both sides.

There are several bus stations around Dhaka, each of them serving a different region of the country. The stations are not for the faint of heart, being extremely crowded and noisy.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sayedabad bus station</strong> is for buses to and from the eastern half of the country, including <a title="Sylhet Division" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Sylhet_Division">Sylhet Division</a> and <a title="Chittagong Division" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Chittagong_Division">Chittagong Division</a>. Sayedabad is currently very chaotic due to the building of a flyover. Roads have been dug up, and traffic is very slow. CNGs in the area all overcharge due to the lack of any order.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Gabtali bus station</strong> is for buses to and from the western half of the country, including <a title="Jessore" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Jessore">Jessore</a>, <a title="Rajshahi Division" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Rajshahi_Division">Rajshahi Division</a> and <a title="Khulna Division" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Khulna_Division">Khulna Division</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Mohakhali bus station</strong> is for buses to and from areas north of Dhaka, including <a title="Tangail" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Tangail">Tangail</a> and <a title="Mymensingh" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Mymensingh">Mymensingh</a>. There are occasionally services to and from cities in the north-western portion of the country, such as Bagura.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Luxury buses</strong> serve locations dotted all over the country. These private buses are air-conditioned, spacey and usually have reclinable seats. Popular operators include <a class="external text" href="http://greenlineparibahan.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Green Line</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://shyamoli.paribahan.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Shyamoli</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://paribahan.com/paribahan/silkline_browsers/silkline_main.php?/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Silk Line</a> and <a class="external text" href="http://shohagh.com/group/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=53" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Shohagh</a>.</p>\r\n<p>They all have ticket offices around town, the most well-known being those at the Pantapath.

The most common method is the air-conditioned buses from <a title="Kolkata" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Kolkata">Kolkata</a> to Dhaka, via the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Haridaspur" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Haridaspur">Haridaspur</a>/<a title="Benapole" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Benapole">Benapole</a> border crossing. The private bus companies listed above also run cross-border services from India. Public buses run under the label of the state-owned West Bengal Surface Transport Service Corporation (WBSTSC) and the <a class="external text" href="http://brtc.gov.bd/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation</strong></a> (BRTC). WBSTSC and BRTC both operate buses from Kolkata every Tu, Th and Sa at 05:30, 08:30, 12:30, while from Dhaka they leave M, W and F at 07:00 and 07:30. The normal journey time is around 12 hours, with a one-way fare of INR800 (non air-con) &amp; INR1400(air-con) or BDT600-800 (roughly USD12-20). The journey just to the Indian border town of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Haridaspur" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Haridaspur">Haridaspur</a> will take 2 and a half hours, with a fare of approximately INR86, or BDT116.</p>\r\n<p>There are no travel options from Myanmar, as the border is closed.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_car" class="mw-headline">By car</span></h3>\r\n<p>It is possible to cross from India via private vehicle. There are many border crossings, but the most popular is the one at <a class="mw-redirect" title="Haridaspur" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Haridaspur">Haridaspur</a>/<a title="Benapole" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Benapole">Benapole</a>, located on the highway between Dhaka and Kolkata. Visa formalities take a notoriously long time.</p>\r\n<p>The border with Myanmar is closed and heavily militarised with land mines.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_water" class="mw-headline">By water</span></h3>\r\n<p>Most ferries arrive at and leave from the port in <strong>Sadarghat</strong> of Old Dhaka. This area and the streets surrounding it are unbelievably hectic, so allow plenty of time and keep an eye on your valuables. If arriving at the port, fight your way to the left on the frontage road and then make your first right; this turns into Nawabpur Road and leads north to the hotels. Even if you aren''t staying in this area, it''s easier to walk several hundred meters north to catch an onward rickshaw or taxi; the ones near the port are at a constant standstill.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Rocket Steamers</strong> (named P.S. ''Tern'', ''Masud'' and ''Ostrich'') depart to <a title="Barisal" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Barisal">Barisal</a> and <a title="Khulna" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Khulna">Khulna</a> several times per week, leaving from Sadarghat around 6pm. To Barisal is Tk 480 and Tk 300 in first and second class respectively, while the ride to Khulna will run Tk 1010 for first class and Tk 610 for second. The Khulna trip takes 26-30 hours. Tickets should be booked at the <a class="external text" href="http://biwtc.gov.bd/notice.php/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">BIWTC</a> office in Motijheel, just east of Dilkusha Circle I. It''s open until 5PM Sunday to Wednesday, until 2PM on Thursdays and closed on Fridays.</p>\r\n<p><a title="Chandpur" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Chandpur">Chandpur</a> is a second major river station, located 3-4 hours from Dhaka and 5-6 hours from Barisal.</p>\r\n<p>Numerous other boats are available for short and long distances. Head to Sadarghat or Badamtoli ghat (about 1 km further west) and ask around. Tickets cannot be pre-booked and bargaining is likely necessary.</p>\r\n<h2><span id="Get_around" class="mw-headline">Get around</span></h2>\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 302px;"><a class="image" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/File:Dhaka.jpg"><img class="thumbimage" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/e/e4/Dhaka.jpg/300px-Dhaka.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" data-file-width="500" data-file-height="350" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="thumb tright">\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 302px;">\r\n<div class="thumbcaption">Old Dhaka</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Well...Dhaka has wide range of transport systems from cycle-rickshaws to buses to water buses. A public transport system is existent which is on a reformation process. However, Dhaka suffers from choking traffic which causes extensive travel time.</p>\r\n<div class="thumb tright">\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 377px;"><a class="image" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/File:Rickshaws.jpg"><img class="thumbimage" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//0/0a/Rickshaws.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" data-file-width="375" data-file-height="500" /></a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="thumb tright">\r\n<div class="thumbinner" style="width: 377px;">\r\n<div class="thumbcaption">Rickshaws, Old Dhaka</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3><span id="By_cycle_rickshaw" class="mw-headline">By cycle rickshaw</span></h3>\r\n<p>Cycle rickshaws or simply, rickshaws, are the most popular form of transport, and good for short distances, mainly on side streets. They make up the bulk of the city''s horrendous traffic, and charge around Tk 30 to 50 for a 15 minutes ride in Banani, Baridhara or Gulshan - less in other parts of Dhaka. Negotiating a fare beforehand is essential as a foreigner. Rickshaws are not allowed to cross most of the main roads. If you''re a woman, it''s particularly inadvisable to ride around alone in rickshaws after dark; you''re a slow-moving target asking for trouble from thugs and muggers.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_auto-rickshaw" class="mw-headline">By auto-rickshaw</span></h3>\r\n<p>Auto-rickshaws, locally known as ''CNGs'' (named after compressed natural gas, their fuel source) are abundant and have meters, which drivers can sometimes be persuaded to use. They''re the cheapest way to cover longer distances; an 8&nbsp;km ride from Old Dhaka to Gulshan should cost around Tk 150-250. The meters start at Tk 25 for the first 2 km and Tk 7 for each subsequent km, but you''ll likely have to negotiate a fare instead. The city does become very congested at times, so allow plenty of time for getting around.</p>\r\n<p>Given the plethora of all forms of transport, if you''re having trouble getting a decent fare with a driver walk a few feet to the next one. Not all are out to gouge you, so better to find the honest ones and give them your business. Occasionally a driver will demand more money on arrival; the best way to deal with this is to hand over the agreed or metered fare and walk away. Make certain from the start that the driver knows where you''re headed (unless you can direct him yourself) - they often have limited local knowledge, but will always say that they know where somewhere is, and take you ''round the whole city searching whilst the meter ticks. Make sure that you take a card with your hotel or hostel written on it so that you can actually get home. Having a card for the hotel with the actual address makes this a whole lot easier.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_taxi" class="mw-headline">By taxi</span></h3>\r\n<p>Taxis are hard to hire from streets so you will need to book one. There are a few types taxis, some yellow and some black, some white, all with meters. Black taxis start the meter at Tk 25 but usually you have to negotiate about the fare. A ride between Old Dhaka and Gulshan in a black cab will probably cost you around Tk 250-350. Yellow taxis have slightly higher standards in terms of comfort but are more expensive and will probably cost you Tk 500. Black and white taxis are typically in notoriously poor condition and lack air conditioning. Yellow taxis are required to have air conditioning; the fleet consists mostly of Toyota Corollas, with some Mitsubishis and Hondas. But if you are a foreigner, a CNG is in many cases the better option because in a car, you are clearly visible as a foreign passenger which will in many cases attract many beggars and street vendors.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_bus_2" class="mw-headline">By bus</span></h3>\r\n<p>Buses run routes on the main roads, but are often horribly crowded and noisy, signed only in Bengali and aren''t likely to be of much use to travelers. But there are some buses which only take passengers if seats are available (at least in theory, but compared to the other buses they are usually not very crowded) and you have to buy a ticket at one of the bus counters in advance. During the rush hour, it can be difficult to get a seat and maybe you will have to wait in line with the other passengers. But taking the bus is cheap and once you found out which bus you have to take and where you have to get off, it is possible without speaking any Bengali. But going by bus takes usually more time than going by CNG and buses are also frequently involved in collisions. Save yourself a headache and take a rickshaw or CNG, or for long distances, a comfortable, air-conditioned bus or train. For more info on buses in Bangladesh, see the Get in section.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_car_2" class="mw-headline">By car</span></h3>\r\n<p>Driving a car in the capital can be a nerve wrecking experience. Officially, cars drive on the left, although the reality can be different. Locals will often zoom down the wrong side of the road in an attempt to overcome the traffic. Traffic police monitor most intersections in the city, in an attempt to keep the traffic flowing. Many intersections have been upgraded with traffic signals, but these are often ignored by both drivers and traffic police, who will direct cars as they see fit.</p>\r\n<p>There are some options for car rental, with Europcar <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.europcar.com/car-BANGLADESH.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">[3]</a> being the notable Western brand name. The Government''s Virtual Bangladesh website <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/rentacar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">[4]</a> has more options. Many companies may also offer the option to rent-a-driver for a number of days; it is common for most middle to upper-class locals to have their own drivers.</p>\r\n<p>If you plan to do a lot of sightseeing in one day, and don''t want to deal with the CNGs, hiring a car and driver is by far the most pleasant way to get around. Rates start at around Tk 2500 per day in an A/C car.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_bike" class="mw-headline">By bike</span></h3>\r\n<p>Many locals often use bicycles as a primary form of transport. They can be useful in their ability to squeeze through tight situations, where traffic may prevent a larger vehicle from moving at all. Some newer roads in the capital have dual bike/rickshaw lanes. Unfortunately, there are few formal opportunities to rent a bike and the roads are in such bad condition, but with heavy traffic, that the chance of a collision is high.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_train" class="mw-headline">By train</span></h3>\r\n<p>The trains in Bangladesh only operate between major regional cities. There is no suburban or metro rail system in Dhaka, although there are plans to build an elevated inner-city line by 2019. Due to this lack, city can become gridlocked for a number of hours.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="By_foot" class="mw-headline">By foot</span></h3>\r\n<p>Sometimes, walking may actually be the fastest way to get from point A to B. Always ensure you walk on the footpath, or if one isn''t available, as far to the side of the road as possible. The road is a dangerous place in Dhaka, and many pedestrians are often injured by passive drivers. Those who are squeamish to pollution or have asthma may need to wear a mask; the air pollution from passing trucks and buses, combined with the searing heat and humidity can be overwhelming at times.</p>', '<h3><span id="Religious_sites" class="mw-headline">Religious sites</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span id="Armenian_Church_of_the_Holy_Resurrection" class="vcard"><span class="fn org">Armenian Church of the Holy Resurrection</span>, <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">Armanitola Rd, Old Dhaka</span></span>, <span class="tel"><abbr class="type" title="voice">â˜Ž</abbr> <span class="phone value">+880 2 731-6953</span></span>. <span class="description">A small, cosy church built in 1781 by Armenian missionaries.

There are numerous mid size malls in every neighborhood of the city. If you go shopping in the street bazaars and markets, ready to bargain then there are certainly bargains to be had among the bazars and markets of Dhaka. To get a feel for what things should cost in the local markets check prices in the western-style fixed price shops and then deduct 10%. If you prefer hassle free shopping then head to Bashundhara City, a huge shopping centre with more modern shops and other ameniteis you would expect to find in a mall.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Banga (or Bango) Bazar</strong>, is a block west of the Gulistan bus station on Kamruzzaman Sharani Street at the edge of Old Dhaka. For shopaholics this is probably a paradise but for others it can be a nightmare. There are thousands of small stalls intersected by narrow walkways which are often jammed with people. The quality varies widely but the prices can be cheap, cheap, cheap, after you bargain vigorously. Try US$1 for a T-shirt, US$3 for blue jeans and US$5 for jackets. However, this is not a market for the brand conscious.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>New Market</strong> on Mirpur Road in Dhanmondi, just west of Dhaka University. This is the largest market in the city and it has more class, more room and just as much choice. Prices may be a little higher because the stall rent is likely to be more expensive. As well as clothing, there is leather, linen, jewellery, household goods, CDs and DVDs and so on. It is normally closed on Tuesdays.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bashundhara City</strong> on Pantha Path just west of the Pan Pacific Hotel. This multi-story complex is the closest replica of the malls found in Asia. It is the newest and most modern place to shop in the city with small shops spanning over a whopping 10 floors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span id="Garment_seconds" class="vcard"><span class="fn org">Garment seconds</span>, <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">Banga Bazar and Pallwell Market</span></span> (<span class="note directions">BB: Gulistan area, just West of Motijheel); PM: Purana Paltan area (just beside Jonaki Cinema Hall</span>). <span class="description">Many items only have minor defects, but do not meet export requirements.</span> &nbsp;<a class="listing-edit" title="click to edit Garment seconds" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Dhaka#Garment_seconds" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span id="Pink_Pearls" class="vcard"><span class="fn org">Pink Pearls</span>. <span class="description">Available in many handicraft stores, with some dedicated outlets in Gulshan.

Old Dhaka is overflowing with cheap Bangladeshi food where a meal can be had from Tk 50 ($0.70), while in the upscale areas such ad Gulshan and Banani you can find just about any type of cuisine you can imagine - Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, Greek, Mexican and franchises such as Pizza Hut, KFC are abundant. Reservations are usually not required in most restaurants. A lot of the buffet-style restaurants in this neighbourhood have Taka: 250 to 400, fixed price menu. For vegetarians, and especially Hindus, beef-free restaurants can be a bit difficult to find, but there are few Indian restaurants where one can get vegetarian food in a beef-free environment.</p>\r\n<p>Local sweets (misti/mishti) like <em>rasogollah</em> and <em>golap jam/pantuya/ledikeni</em> are excellent. To the uninitiated these are bite-sized soft milk curd balls dipped (drenched) in syrup, coming in white and red varieties. Shops throughout the town (and especially near Gulshan) sell imported condiments from the U.S., Dubai and Malaysia at a premium. Imported chocolate is especially expensive - and usually not in the best condition as it gets melted and re-solidified daily in the tropical heat. Fresh is better.</p>\r\n<p>Be careful when buying food from street vendors as health and hygiene standards are not always top notch. Unlike Bangkok -- street food in Dhaka is only for locals. Foreigners should stick to larger, organized, and unfortunately a little expensive, food outlets.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="Old_and_Central_Dhaka" class="mw-headline">Old and Central Dhaka</span></h3>\r\n<p>Restaurants are crammed throughout the narrow alleys and along the main streets, and you''ll likely not to be too disappointed by them.

There''s a very large number of people living on next to nothing in the city, and while the vast majority are friendly there''s undoubtedly a few that would love to help you part with some of your seemingly abundant wealth.</p>\r\n<p>As a foreigner, many beggars will surround you in Gulshan and Banani. Especially children who will try to sell stickers and, if you are not interested in their items, will ask for money or food and try to make you buy some more expensive items in one of the supermarkets or small stores. But before giving something to them, consider that by giving money or buying expensive items, which they will probably resell, that in many cases these children are trained or forced to beg and have to give all the money or items to the person who organises them. So be aware of this and the fact that your gesture of goodwill will maybe support these structures and exploitation. Be careful when you see a group of Hijras. Usually they are rare in Bangladesh, but their begging can be very aggressive.</p>\r\n<p>There has been a recent rash of incidents in which some foreigners have been targeted for bag snatchings while riding rickshaws. Often these have occurred at night, after 23:00. If you must be out after this time please do your best to leave your valuables at your friends'' places or hotel and you can pick them up in the morning. The simplest way to reduce your potential loss is to not leave with valuables in the first place if you anticipate the need to travel after 23:00. The safest mode for travel for a tourist is to hire a yellow cab. These can be rented for a trip as well as by the day. Be sure to write down the license plate number.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest danger probably comes from speeding buses and rickshaws - keep well alert when walking along main roads.</p>\r\n<p>Being the capital, it''s the area most affected during <em>hartals</em>, and you should do your best to keep a low profile during times of political unrest. Avoid <em>any</em> sort of large gatherings, even positive ones, as there''s a good chance you''ll become the centre of attention and you probably don''t want that from a group of raucous chanters.</p>\r\n<p>Pollution is, compared to other countries in the subcontinent, not very high because most vehicles are run by gas. But dust can be a problem, especially during winter when rain is rare. It''s not uncommon to see people with face masks on, and at the very least you should carry a handkerchief with you to cover your mouth and nose during rickshaw rides.</p>\r\n<p>Some places such as Mohammadpur are hot spots for drugs, narcotics, etc. Don''t answer to the people along the streets.</p>', 'upload/banner_5080f27fbd06c5.jpg');

The Rajshahi municipality was established in 1876, one of the first in Bangladesh. There is a total population of 700,000 people. One of the major rivers of the Indian subcontinent, the Padma, runs along the southern end of the city.</p>\r\n<p>The city is home to many educational institutions, leading to a large student population and the nickname of "education city". The city is in proximity to many ancient capitals of Bengal, notably ''Lakhnoiti'' or ''Lokhnaboti'', ''Gauda'' and ''Pundra''. Rajshahi is famous for trade in many exotic items, including pure silk, mangoes and lychees. Attractive silk products are cheaper in Rajshahi than anywhere else in the country, with the city often referred to as the ''silk city''. There are also a number ancient mosques, shrines and temples in and around Rajshahi.

Sylhet has also a very interesting and rich history, Before the conquest by the Muslims, it was ruled by local chieftains. In 1303, the great Saint Hazrat Shah Jalal came to Sylhet from Yemen with a band of 360 disciples to preach Islam and defeated the then Raja Gour Gobinda.</p>\r\n<p>An interesting feature of Sylhet region is the aboriginal tribes such as the Tipperas, the Monipuris, Khasis and Garos who still live in their primitive ways in the hills, practising their age-old rites, rituals, customs and traditions.

Like Dhaka, the streets are filled with masses of rickshaws, though the city puts in a little more effort to keep its streets and sidewalks clean. Foreigners will notice a distinct increase in nuisances from beggars in certain intersections: for example, New Market Circle and the central Railway Station. The majority of the beggars are from other parts of the country such as Greater Mymensingh Region and Greater Noakhali area. They have migrated due to the fact that Chittagonian people are more prone to charity relative to other parts of the country.</p>\r\n<p>The busiest part of town is the area around the train station and Station Road, while things get a little more bearable as you move further north. GEC Circle is the intersection of Zakir Hossain Rd, O. R. Nizam Rd and CDA Avenue, about 3 km north of the train station, and is the center of middle to upper class life with a variety of shady restaurants and shopping.</p>\r\n<p>Chittagong is a conservative place. Local women tend to dress in modest clothing and don''t like to shake hands with men. This does not apply to the upper classes, who are very westernised. Local people aren''t offended when foreigners don''t comply with the expectations of local people. That being said, because Bangladesh in general does not have much tourism, foreigners will receive a lot of attention. Here, it is not considered rude to stare, so passersby stare openly at foreigners, but this is mostly out of curiosity, not malice. Foreigners drinking alcohol or foreign women wearing skirts which show their bare legs are going to upset people. However, even if you wear conservative dress, such as punjabis and shalwar kameez, people will still stare if you do not look Bangladeshi.</p>\r\n<p>In the more affluent neighborhoods like Khulshi and Nasirabad, local women are more westernised. The parties that let women have fun are mostly indoors, such as the Chittagong Club or Hotel Agrabad.</p>\r\n<p>The Chittagonian enthusiasm for inviting people to massive feasts is a bit of a legend both locally and elsewhere in Bangladesh. Known as <em>mezbani,</em> these feasts feature a tremendously hot curry, usually of beef.

His daily routine was to attend to his duties in the Court and to engage in prayers. No one knew that he was spiritually endowed nor did he pose to be such. His spiritual greatness was revealed through a <em>Karamat</em> (spiritual power with magical elements recieved from The Almighty Allah) which brought him to the limelight and people came to know that he was a <em>Wali</em> (saint) of the highest rank. When his spiritual attainments became known, he resigned from his job and remained busy with spiritual religious act and meditation. He is ranked among the greatest saints of Chittagong.

On the side of both the peaks reside the remotest tribes-people of Bangladesh - the Khumi and the Kuki. Boga Lake, one of the two highest lakes in Bangladesh lie directly on the trek, while the other one, the Raikhiang Lake lies only a little off the way.</p>', '<p>There is an abundance of Brumese, Thai and Chinese trinkets, textile and other stuff in the town. But, the best buy is definitely the products of local handloom - cloth fabric, shawls, blankets and more - as well as products of bamboo, cane and wood - buskets, flutes, hats, mask and more. Prices are amazingly low, and textile qualities are amazingly high. The designs are refreshingly exotic and extremely geometric.

Look for <em>Nappi</em>, a local delicacy, to take home here. But, don''t forget to pack it tight when carrying. This market bustles with activity in the earl morning, with tribes-people coming down the hills to sell vegetables of every color, as well as roots, tubers, fruits, berries and nuts.</li>\r\n<li><strong>M/S Rangdhanu Enterprise:</strong>This shop are located front side of Hla Hla Burmise Market in Moddom Para.

A thicket of tailoring shops line the streets of both markets to cater to buyers of these cloths. It is a fun activity for women to buy cloth and take it to a tailoring shop. Custom fit <em>Thami</em> (sarong) and <em>Angi</em> (Blouse) are tailored in a day.</p>', '<h3><span id="Budget" class="mw-headline">Budget</span></h3>\r\n<p>There are good restaurants in Bandarban Bazaar where local cuisine can be sampled, which is mostly too hot for unaccustomed palates.</p>\r\n<h3><span id="Mid-range" class="mw-headline">Mid-range</span></h3>\r\n<p>The best places to eat are Khaoa Daoa (a <em>Muslim</em> restaurant, meaning they serve beef) and Adarsha Bhaatghar (a <em>Hindu</em> restaurant, meaning they don''t serve beef).</p>\r\n<h3><span id="Splurge" class="mw-headline">Splurge</span></h3>\r\n<p>Chinese or Continental food, though available and expensive by local standards, is of poor quality here.

It is best drunk with coconut juice. <em>Ching Rey</em> is a beer made from the first brew of Arraa. Tea is a fairly common drink in the daytime, and available at plentiful hot tea shops. Tea here is well-cooked and served with thin milk and salt instead of sugar.</p>\r\n<p>There is no formal nightlife here.
